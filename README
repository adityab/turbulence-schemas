Metastreams is a framework made with Node.js and Mongoose/MongoDB
for microblogging of arbitrary semantic data (locations, contacts, 
images, videos, quizzes, etc) by arbitrary kinds of agents (people,
pages, programs, sensors, etc). 

It aims to become a highly extensible annotation microblogging framework
upon which services such as twitter, tumblr, disqus, pinterest, etc can be built.
